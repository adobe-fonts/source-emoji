# Source Emoji

ðŸ˜ƒ Source Emoji is an emoji font project that began development in order to provide monochrome representative glyphs to the [Unicode Consortium](http://unicode.org/) for emoji candidates that have been accepted by the UTC (Unicode Technical Committee) but have not yet been fully ratified to become a part of the official standard.

The glyph artwork has been designed to harmonize with other Source fonts. The ultimate goal for this project is to grow it *slowly* over time to cover the full set of characters in Unicode that can take emoji presentation and eventually include colored SVG artwork for greater usability as emoji.

## Characters currently supported

Flag combinations are XXX
Missing characters will display as a sad alien.
