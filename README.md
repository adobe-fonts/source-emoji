# Source Emoji

Source Emoji is currently a monochrome emoji font project that began development in order to provide monochrome artwork to the Unicode Consortium for emoji candidates that have not yet been ratified to become a part of the official standard. The glyph artwork has been designed to harmonize with other Source fonts. The ultimate goal for this project is to grow it *slowly* over time to cover the full set of characters in Unicode that can take emoji presentation and eventually include colored SVG artwork for greater usability as emoji.
